## Neural Networks

1. Neural Network:
[x] Supports any number of layers
[x] Supports any number of neurons per layer
[ ] Train:
    [ ] Forward Propagation
    [ ] Back Propagation  
[x] Predict
[ ] Train in Epochs
[ ] Verbose training phase 

2. Activation Functions:
[x] Sigmoid (Non linear mapping between 0 and 1)
[x] Softmax (Non Linear Probability Distribution)
[x] ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
[x] Leaky ReLU (Leaking ReLU on negative values)
[x] TanH (Hyperbolic Tangent)
[x] ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)

3. Utility Functions:
[x] Flatten ()
[x] One Hot Encoding
[x] Accurary function
[x] Loss functions:
    - Root Mean Squared Error
